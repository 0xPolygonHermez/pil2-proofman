# Proofs Manager

The Proof Manager is an adaptable Proof Manager designed to assist in the creation of proofs from a PIL2 pilout-formatted file. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the [PIL2](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/pilcom) compiler and proofman-js [pil2-proofman-js](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/pil2-proofman-js) to generate the setup.
